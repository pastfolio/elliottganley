          I’m a 19-year-old finance student at the University of Strathclyde in the
          United Kingdom. I grew up in Hampshire, England before moving to Palo Alto,
          California at the age of ten, an experience that gave me a broad view of both
          British and American perspectives on business and technology.

          My interest in investing started in high school after reading{" "}
          <em>The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham</em> and <em>The Most Important Thing by Howard Marks</em>. Those books sparked
          a lasting fascination with how businesses create value and why some companies
          endure while others fade. Over time, that interest expanded into technology and
          the way it reshapes industries and behavior, especially during periods like the
          early internet and dot-com era.

          I’m currently learning more about how ideas evolve into companies and how
          capital supports innovation. I hope to build a career that brings together my
          interests in technology, investing, and long-term thinking.
